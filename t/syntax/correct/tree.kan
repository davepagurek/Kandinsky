define branch as
  rectangle: {x: -4, y: -50, width: 8, height: 54}.

define tree as
  given: {
    that: lt: {lhs: random, rhs: 0.8},
    then:
      branch;
      with: {drawing:
        tree;
        stretched: {x: 0.8, y: 0.75};
        rotated: {angle: random: {from: -90, to: 90}};
        shifted: {up: 50}
      },
    else: branch
  }.

define result as tree;
  shifted: {down: 400, right: 400}.
